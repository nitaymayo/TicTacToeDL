# TicTacToeDL
an AI algorithm written in pure Python that can play tic-tac-toe and learn to become a proficient player.

<p>
  This is an AI algorithm written in pure Python
  that is capable of playing the game of tic-tac-toe
  and learning from its experiences to become a
  proficient player. The algorithm is built upon deep
  learning concepts, allowing it to train itself
  without any human intervention. Through repeated plays,
  the algorithm can learn from its mistakes and achievements,
  making better moves as it progresses. The algorithm is
  implemented using a constantly growing database, which is trained on
  the various board states and corresponding moves that
  lead to a win. The database, which functions as the player mind takes in the current
  board state and outputs the best move to make, based on
  the data it has been trained on.

  The algorithm makes use of a technique called reinforcement
  learning, which is a subset of machine learning that involves
  training an AI agent to make decisions in an environment. In
  this case, the environment is the game of tic-tac-toe, and the
  AI agent is the algorithm I built. The algorithm is trained to
  maximize its chances of winning by receiving positive reinforcement
  for good moves and negative reinforcement for bad moves. As the
  algorithm continues to play, it learns to associate certain board
  states with better moves, eventually becoming a highly skilled
  tic-tac-toe player. Overall, this project was a great exercise in
  applying deep learning concepts to a real-world problem and creating
  an AI agent that can learn and improve over time.
